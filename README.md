# Hi there, I'm Maha ðŸ‘‹

I'm an experienced Android developer with a passion for building compelling, high-quality mobile applications. I work using both native Android (Kotlin) and Flutter (cross-platform), and my projects feature modern architectural patterns like MVVM along with Android Jetpack components.  

One of my favorite projects, **Kolaru Pathigam**, is a released app available on the [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.maha.kolaru_pathigam).
